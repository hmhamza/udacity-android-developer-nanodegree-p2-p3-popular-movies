# Popular Movies, Stage 2

### Project Overview
Welcome back to Popular Movies! In this second and final stage, I added additional functionality to the app I built in Stage 1.

I added more information to the movie details view:

- Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
- Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
- Create a database and content provider to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
- Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
### What I Learnt?
- I built a fully featured application that looks and feels natural on the latest Android operating system (Nougat, as of November 2016).
